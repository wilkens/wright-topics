  "title": "Wright C19 Fiction",
  "meta_info": "<p>100 topics from a collection of 1,543 novels published in the United States between 1774 and 1875. There are a few date outliers included, but every volume is catalogued in Lyle Wright's <em>Bibliography of American Fiction</em>, vol. 1 or 2. Be aware that there are very few volumes published before about 1820.</p><p>You'll note that things are a bit rough: bibliographies are badly formatted, full text links don't work, etc. I hope to clean this up soon, but am pushing it live for <a href="http://mattwilkens.com/teaching/digital-humanities-graduate-seminar-spring-2014/">classroom use</a> this semester."
