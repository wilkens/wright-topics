  "title": "Wright C19 Fiction",
  "meta_info": "<p>100 topics from a collection of 1,543 novels published in the United States between 1774 and 1875. There are a few date outliers included, but every volume is catalogued in Lyle Wright's <em>Bibliography of American Fiction</em>, vol. 1 or 2. Be aware that there are very few volumes published before about 1820.</p><p>Note that this is still kind of rough. The data should be correct, but the bibliography is badly formatted and there are links to full texts that don't exist. Will clean this up eventually, probably, but pushing it live for <a href="http://mattwilkens.com/teaching/digital-humanities-graduate-seminar-spring-2014/">class use</a> this semester."
